What does it do?
----------------

Responsive design is great, but providing the right image size to any device is a challenging task.

This extension of the Bootstrap Package solve this problem by pre-computing the real size of images for each "breakpoint" on any layout.
Taking care of the delivery of the right image using any modern <picture> <srcset> or javascript based data-attribute solution using media query.

- <img srcset> in size="" tag with screen width percentage and breakpoints media query, and generated image width in source="" tag.
- <picture> with appropriate media queries screen size and pixel density attributes.
- with custom advanced lazy-load javascript solution using data-attributes.

Out of the box, the settings are matching bootstrap's default.
