A typo3 bootstrap_package extension to allow real image width generation for any breakpoint in fluid design

Currently, typo3 core only allow to set width of images without any layout relationship.

This ends up into providing images far larger than client would have needed (think about a picture in a 6 column layout rendered at 1200 / 600 / 300 px while only making 100px). Not only this consume bandwidth, but also energy to downsize images in the browsers.

Providing some care, it's possible to pre-compute real image size in nearly every layout for every breakpoint. Adding full support for correct img srcset and picture tag, and data-attributes lazyload solution, and css background.

**The cons :**

- Precomputing 5 to 10 images (breakpoints +1) * 2 if retina can be time consuming on first load of the page.
- Configuration to take account of grid system, breakpoints, and content frames.
- Adapting templates to make system aware of layout.

**The pros :**

- Less bandwith
- Less energy
- Less time to load
- Automagic once configuration done, but with standards grids setups it should be ok right out of the box.
